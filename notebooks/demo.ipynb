    "The mining problem can be treated as a classical max flow problem in graph theory. Alternatively, it can be mapped to a quantum problem via constructing an appropriate Hamiltonian. A typical choice is to use Ising spin states to represent dug/undug states for each node. $|0\\rangle$ means undug and $|1\\rangle$ means dug. Then the profit term $H_{p}$ should be a sum of weighted Pauli matrices in Z direction ($Z$), and the mining constraints are encoded in the smoothness term $H_{s}$. The tunning parameter $\\lambda$ controls the \"importance\" of the smoothness term: a high $\\lambda$ could result in trivial mining configurations, while a low $\\lambda$ could result in invalid configurations with high profit. In practice, $\\lambda$ is decided empirically for each mining problem. We may refer $\\lambda$ as the \"penalty\" factor in the following instructions.\n",
